<p>quote_0: &#8220;If a relatively ubiquitous network of levitating nanobot routers and sensors is capable of overriding human volition, then will human intended physical assault stop?&#8221;</p>
<p>quote_1: &#8220;I think it is possible (and favorable to assume (due to the possibility that the amount of cognitive resources which are allocated to goal-oriented tasks tends to make the fulfillment of such goals most likely to occur if a certain threshold of cognitive resources are allocated which flip a binary switch in metaphysical space from off to on)) that a person wills itself into existence (and whatever space-time continuum and whatever avatar into existence as a consequence of desire).&#8221;</p>
<p><strike>quote_2: &#8220;Not all desires are obvious to their beholder (but all desire is palpable to their beholder; however subtly).&#8221;</strike></p>
<p>quote_3: &#8220;Desire is an emergent property which is a function of space, time, matter, and energy arranged in a particular matter such that a barrier between finite physical phenomena and noumena is generated and, if resource investment (i.e. function input) continues at a sufficiently high rate, that function output pattern is likely to continue manifesting.&#8221;</p>
